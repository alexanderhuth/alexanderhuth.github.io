# alexanderhuth.com

Professional/personal website of Alexander Huth.

## Stack
- Static Github Pages site generated by Jekyll.
- Pages live in `pages/` (e.g., `consulting.md`, `concerts.md`, `links.md`, `uses.md`); `index.md` and `404.md` stay at the root. Posts are under `_posts/`, and supporting templates sit in `_layouts/` and `_includes/`.
- Colors and typography are handled in `assets/style.css` with a random theme class added in `_includes/html-head.html`.

## Local development
- Serve locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`; the site will be available at the printed localhost URL.
- GitHub Pages uses the same `github-pages` gem, so local builds match production.

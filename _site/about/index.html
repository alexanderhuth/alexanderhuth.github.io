      <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Alexander. I live in beautiful Berlin-Wannsee with my wonderful girlfriend Kate and our two cats, Mimi and Luna.</p>

<p>I was born in 1987 and grew up in Neubrandenburg, where I also went to school. My parents are teachers, and I have a sister.</p>

<p>I moved to Berlin in 2007 to study German Studies and Communication Studies at Freie Universität Berlin. In 2009, I began my career in SEO at Rocket Internet. I later joined an SEO agency in 2012, followed by a travel startup in 2013. During my time there, I helped grow the company from 10 to 300 people, experienced rapid scaling firsthand — and eventually burned out.</p>

<p>In 2019, I became a freelance SEO consultant. Since then, I’ve worked across industries with both small startups and publicly listed companies. I also taught as a guest lecturer at a small university in 2023 and again in 2025.</p>

<p>For 18 years, I lived in Northern Schöneberg and Southern Tiergarten before moving to Wannsee in 2025.</p>

<p>I’ve supported Bayer 04 Leverkusen ever since Michael Ballack scored an own goal against Unterhaching. Spending time in California during the 2013 NFL Playoffs turned me into a 49ers Faithful. And while I still don’t fully understand all the intricacies of rugby, I try to attend Bristol Bears games whenever we’re visiting Kate’s family and friends in North Somerset.</p>

# alexanderhuth.com

Professional/personal website of Alexander Huth.

## Stack
- Static Github Pages site generated by Jekyll.
- The pages live at the project root (e.g., `index.md`, `consulting.md`, `concerts.md`, `links.md`, `uses.md`), posts are under `_posts/`, and supporting templates sit in `_layouts/` and `_includes/`.
- Colors and typography are handled in `assets/css/main.css` with a random theme class added in `_includes/html-head.html`.

## Local development
- Install Ruby (with Bundler) and run `bundle install`.
- Serve locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`; the site will be available at the printed localhost URL.
- GitHub Pages uses the same `github-pages` gem, so local builds match production.

## Structure to remember
- Layouts: `home.html`, `page.html`, `post.html` use shared head/header/footer includes.
- Global styles: `assets/css/main.css` defines the theme palettes and UI components; a small script in `html-head.html` randomly applies a theme class.
- Data: `concerts.md` reads from `_data/concerts.yml` (sorted and grouped by year).
- Navigation: the footer links to `/slashes/` and `/links/`; `/slashes/` auto-lists every non-post page.
- Config: `_config.yml` sets site metadata, feeds, and social links; `README` is excluded from builds.

## Handy context for Codex
- Treat root-level `.md` files as pages with `layout: page`; posts need dated filenames under `_posts/`.
- If you add CSS, keep palette variables in `assets/css/main.css`; avoid touching the inline theme picker unless you want to change the random background behavior.
- When editing navigation or meta tags, start from `_includes/header.html`, `_includes/footer.html`, and `_includes/html-head.html`.
- The site is intentionally minimal—prefer small HTML/Liquid edits over adding new dependencies.

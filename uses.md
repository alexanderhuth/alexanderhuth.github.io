## This website
This site runs on Jekyll with simple Liquid templates, a tiny inline script to randomize color themes, and a single handmade CSS file—no build pipeline or JavaScript beyond that. It’s published as static HTML on GitHub Pages, uses a domain from iwantmyname, and I work on it in Visual Studio Code with OpenAI Codex.

# Hello 👋

Hi, I’m Alexander. I’m a Marketing consultant, advisor, and mentor focused on helping companies grow organically. [You should work with me](/consulting/).   

I’m based in Berlin and spend my time cycling, collecting records, going to concerts, drinking pourover coffee, making lists, and obsessing over films.

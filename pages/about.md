# About Me

My name is Alexander. I live in beautiful Berlin-Wannsee with my wonderful girlfriend Kate and our two cats, Mimi and Luna.

I was born in 1987 and grew up in Neubrandenburg, where I also went to school. My parents are teachers, and I have a sister.

I moved to Berlin in 2007 to study German Studies and Communication Studies at Freie Universität Berlin. In 2009, I began my career in SEO at Rocket Internet. I later joined an SEO agency in 2012, followed by a travel startup in 2013. During my time there, I helped grow the company from 10 to 300 people, experienced rapid scaling firsthand — and eventually burned out.

In 2019, I became a freelance SEO consultant. Since then, I’ve worked across industries with both small startups and publicly listed companies. I also taught as a guest lecturer at a small university in 2023 and again in 2025.

For 18 years, I lived in Northern Schöneberg and Southern Tiergarten before moving to Wannsee in 2025.

I’ve supported Bayer 04 Leverkusen ever since Michael Ballack scored an own goal against Unterhaching. Spending time in California during the 2013 NFL Playoffs turned me into a 49ers Faithful. And while I still don’t fully understand all the intricacies of rugby, I try to attend Bristol Bears games whenever we’re visiting Kate’s family and friends in North Somerset.
